description: 'Since its inception in 2012, Samagra has been working with
                governments at various levels across the country. We have
                synthesized our learnings from these 10 years in the form of two
                frameworks- The Governance Matrix and Panchsutras for Governance
                Transformation. These frameworks will be useful for those
                working in the government as well as for those working with the
                government.'
