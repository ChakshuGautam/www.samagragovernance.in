      Anamaya is a health system transformation program with the aim of
      improving accessibility, quality, and speed of care in public healthcare
      facilities. This is part of the â€œTribal Health Collaborative'' formed by
      the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Piramal Foundation to improve
      health outcomes of tribal and other marginalized communities. As part of
      the program, Samagra is supporting the Government of Odisha in building
      institutional capacity, strengthening healthcare delivery channels, and
      promoting health-seeking behaviour among the citizens through
      communitization.
