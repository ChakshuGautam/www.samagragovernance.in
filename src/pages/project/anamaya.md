      Anamaya is a health system transformation program with the aim of
      improving accessibility, quality, and speed of care in public healthcare
      facilities. This is part of the “Tribal Health Collaborative'' formed by
      the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Piramal Foundation to improve
      health outcomes of tribal and other marginalized communities. As part of
      the program, Samagra is supporting the Government of Odisha in building
      institutional capacity, strengthening healthcare delivery channels, and
      promoting health-seeking behaviour among the citizens through
      communitization.

approach:
  - text: >-
      Our approach to transforming tribal population’s experience at public
      healthcare facilities is centered on building institutional capacity, and
      strengthening public healthcare service delivery channels in the system
      given its current low resource capacity. This involves interventions to
      augment doctor availability, build capacity of frontline workers,
      streamline review and monitoring mechanisms and medicine availability and
      so on. In cognizance of distinctive tribal realities and challenges,
      interventions have been contextualized for implementation in tribal areas
      while some solutions are exclusively targeted at tribal population.
      Further all interventions are focused on priority health programs like the
      Reproductive and Child Health program and the Non-Communicable Diseases
      program. While there is a strong emphasis on supply side system
      strengthening, adoption of demand side health promotion activities to
      increase awareness and build people’s trust in the system is also being
      undertaken.
